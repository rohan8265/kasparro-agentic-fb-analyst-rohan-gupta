## Executive summary
For campaign **WOMEN Seamless Everydy** (2025-02-01 → 2025-03-31) we detected a significant decline in ROAS and low CTR. The primary validated cause is creative fatigue. Recommended immediate actions: rotate creatives, run a 10% A/B test for 7 days, and expand audience targeting.

## Key findings
- Avg CTR over period: **0.0053** (25th pct = 0.0094) → flagged low CTR
- ROAS change: **12.8 → 1.2** (drop = **-11.6**)
- Validated cause: Creative fatigue (CTR down 35% month-over-month, p=0.0002)

## Evidence
- Negative CTR slope across last 30 days
- Top creatives repeated similar product-focused copy with no urgency or social proof
- Frequency > 4 suggesting audience saturation

## Recommendations
1. Rotate creatives using urgency and social proof variants (see `creatives.json`).
2. Run an A/B test: 10% traffic to each new variant vs control for 7 days.
3. Expand audience by +20% (broader lookalike threshold) to reduce frequency.
4. Monitor: CTR, CVR, ROAS daily; re-evaluate after 7 days.

## Creative suggestions (summary)
- `v1` All-day comfort. Zero pinch. — CTA: Try 2-Pack — goal: increase CTR
- `v2` Summer-ready. Sweat-wicking boxers. — CTA: Shop Summer — goal: increase CTR
- `v3` Love the fit—98% recommend. — CTA: See Reviews — goal: improve CTR-quality

## Limitations
- Dataset is synthetic; some real-world signals (warehouse stockouts, landing-page A/B tests, external events) are not present.
- Tests with impressions < 10k are flagged `data_quality: low` and require longer runs or bootstrapped inference.

## Next steps
- Implement creative rotations and launch A/B tests
- Capture post-test metrics and re-run the Evaluator agent
